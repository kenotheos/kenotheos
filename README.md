# personal social links page,

built this website as my own linktree, it contains a list of my links, also a link to a page where you can donate to me and maybe help me share cooler stuff online, :3

##  tech stack

i intentionally built the website with a focus on simplicity and performance, using only fundamental web tools like :

* **HTML5:** 
* **CSS3:** 
* **JavaScript:**

## setup and deployment

this is a static website with no build steps or dependencies.

* **Local Development:** to run the site locally, simply clone this repository and open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
* **Deployment:** the live version is automatically deployed from the `main` branch to **Cloudflare Pages**. any push to this branch will trigger a new deployment.
